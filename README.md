# Function Pointers and Operations in C

This project demonstrates the use of function pointers and a custom comparer function in C. The program completes two tasks:

1. Task 1: Implements a comparer function to sort an array using `qsort`.
2. Task 2: Implements a calculator program that performs different arithmetic operations based on user input without using conditional statements.

## Files

- func-ptr.c: Contains the main code for both tasks.
- README.md: Project documentation.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Compile the Code

   To compile `func-ptr.c`, use the following command to ensure compatibility with C99 standards:

   ```bash
   gcc -std=c99 func-ptr.c -o func_ptr
